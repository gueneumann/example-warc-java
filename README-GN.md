# How to Use it to Extract Sentences from Web pages

GÃ¼nter Neumann 2016/10/20

Maybe I can use some of the code from https://github.com/xdavidjung/cluewebextractor
and adapt it to java.

I have test files in /Users/gune00/ownCloud/cluebweb09-de/

# http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/

I think this is the right tool.

I forked it: https://github.com/gueneumann/boilerpipe

The API shows exactly, what it should do, so I think this is it.
