# How to Use it to Extract Sentences from Web pages

GÃ¼nter Neumann 2016/10/20

Maybe I can use some of the code from https://github.com/xdavidjung/cluewebextractor
and adapt it to java.

I have test files in /Users/gune00/ownCloud/cluebweb09-de/

## http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/

I think this is the right tool.

I forked it: https://github.com/gueneumann/boilerpipe

I integrated poiler pipe via

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.robbypond</groupId>
		<artifactId>boilerpipe</artifactId>
		<version>1.2.3</version>

The API shows exactly, what it should do, so I think this is it.

This shows how to extract text:

Installed and tested, and works.

## How to combined with commoncrawl ?

First test in test.gn.TestReadTextFromWARC

- streams a local *.warc.gz file

- for each record of type response

- gets the URL and Content in UTF-8

- and than extracts title and text using test.gn.TextExtractorDemo called via test.gn.MyProcessWarcRecord

- it creats a boilerpipe HMTLDocument and extracts title and text using getTitle() and getText()
